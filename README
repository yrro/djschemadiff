djschemadiff - show differences between Django database schemas
===============================================================
Sam Morris <sam@robots.org.uk>

'djschemadiff' is a tool to help you keep the schema your
http://www.djangoproject.com/[Django] web application's database up to date.

It compares the schema of your current database with that which would be
produced if you started with a fresh, empty database and then ran `syncdb`, and
shows you the difference between the two.

Run `djschemadiff.py --help` for usage information.

Downloads
---------
Releases of 'djschemadiff' can be downloaded from
http://robots.org.uk/src/djschemadiff/releases/[].

Requirements
------------
djschemadiff 0.3 has the following requirements:

 * http://www.python.org/[Python] version 2.3 or later.

 * http://www.djangoproject.com/[Django] version 1.1 or later. Version 1.0
   may be sufficient; please let me know if you have tried it. If you have
   an older version of Django then try djschemadiff 0.2.

 * http://www.postgresql.org/[PostgreSQL] version 8.3 or later. `pgembed.py`
   currently assumes you are using Debian and PostgreSQL 8.4; for other
   operating systems and versions of PostgreSQL you will have to edit that file
   to point to your PostgreSQL executables. If you have PostgreSQL 8.1 or 8.2
   then you can try djschemadiff 0.2.

 * http://www.initd.org/tracker/psycopg[psycopg2] module. The old psycopg
   module also works.

 * http://www.vim.org/[vim] (optional; used if you specify `--mode=vimdiff`)

Sample Output
-------------
Here is what the default 'udiff' (unified diff) mode produces:

 $ djschemadiff.py mysite/settings.py
 ... lots of output from PostgreSQL elided ...

 +++ new-schema

  );

  ALTER TABLE ONLY articles_article ADD CONSTRAINT articles_article_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id);

Bugs and Limitations
---------------------
Currently 'djschemadiff' is limited to only supporting PostgreSQL, but only
because that is the only database that I use. Extending 'djschemadiff' to
support other databases (including different versions of PostgreSQL) should be
fairly easy. Patches welcome!
